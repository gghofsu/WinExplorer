# Testing WinExplorer

The unit tests (`dotnet test`) cover the parts that do not need Explorer. Everything that
touches tabs has to be verified on a real Windows 11 machine; this is the checklist used
before a release.

## Automated

```powershell
dotnet test WinExplorer.sln -c Release
```

| Area | Covered by |
|---|---|
| Path normalisation (URLs, slashes, `%VARS%`, shell GUIDs) | `PathNormalizerTests` |
| Shortcut parsing / rendering / conflict checks | `HotkeySpecTests` |
| Command line parsing (context menu verbs, switches, errors) | `CommandLineTests` |
| Closed-tab history (order, capacity, de-duplication) | `TabHistoryTests` |
| Settings round-trip, corrupt files, sanitising | `SettingsStoreTests` |

## Manual checklist (Windows 11 22H2+)

Preparation: start `WinExplorer.exe`, make sure the header says **Active**, and have
`%APPDATA%\WinExplorer\WinExplorer.log` open.

### Opening

- [ ] Double-click a folder in Explorer → a **new tab** appears in the same window and is
      focused; no new window flashes.
- [ ] Double-click the **same** folder again → that tab is brought to the front, the tab
      count does not change.
- [ ] Open folder `A` in window 1, then double-click `A` inside a *different* Explorer
      window → the first window comes forward with tab `A` selected.
- [ ] Hold `Ctrl` and double-click a folder → Windows opens a normal new window (no tab).
- [ ] Double-click a **file** → it opens normally (the click is replayed).
- [ ] Double-click empty space in the file list → nothing unusual happens.
- [ ] Middle-click a folder → a background tab appears, focus stays where it was.
- [ ] Double-click a folder in the **navigation pane** → unchanged Windows behaviour.
- [ ] Double-click `This PC`, `Recycle Bin`, a library → Windows behaviour.
- [ ] Double-click a folder inside an archive (`zip:`) → Windows behaviour.
- [ ] Double-click a folder on the **desktop** → with the default-handler option on: tab in
      the existing window. Off: normal window (or folded in, if window folding is on).

### Duplicates on demand

- [ ] Right-click a folder → *Open in new tab* → always a new tab, even when it is already
      open (with WinExplorer's own verb and with Explorer's built-in item).
- [ ] Right-click a folder → *Open in new window* → a separate window, even with window
      folding enabled.
- [ ] `Alt+Shift+D` in Explorer → duplicate tab.
- [ ] `WinExplorer.exe --open "C:\Temp" --new-tab` → duplicate tab.
- [ ] `WinExplorer.exe --open "C:\Temp" --new-window` → new window.

### Shortcuts and state

- [ ] `Alt+Shift+T` after closing a tab → the folder is reopened as a tab.
- [ ] `Ctrl+Alt+P` pauses (tray icon text changes, header says Paused); double-clicking a
      folder then behaves like plain Windows.
- [ ] `Ctrl+Alt+P` again resumes.
- [ ] Change a shortcut in the UI, press the new chord → it works; the old one no longer
      fires.
- [ ] Restart WinExplorer → settings and shortcuts survive.

### Window folding

- [ ] Enable *Fold other new Explorer windows into tabs*; open a folder from Start → it is
      folded into a tab without a visible window flash.
- [ ] Enable it; use *Open in new window* from the context menu → stays a window.
- [ ] Hold `Ctrl+Shift` while opening a window → stays a window.
- [ ] Detach a tab (drag it out) with folding enabled → the detached window stays.
- [ ] Sign out/in with folding enabled → restored session windows are not eaten.

### Integration and hygiene

- [ ] Toggle *Add "Open in WinExplorer tab"…* off → the verb disappears from the context
      menu and the previous default folder handler is restored.
- [ ] Toggle *Start WinExplorer when I sign in* → check
      `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` contains/does not contain
      `WinExplorer`.
- [ ] `WinExplorer.exe --exit` stops the tray icon.
- [ ] Start WinExplorer a second time → the settings window of the running instance appears
      (no second tray icon).
- [ ] Restart Explorer (`explorer.exe` kill) → WinExplorer keeps running and tabs work again
      afterwards.

### Edge cases

- [ ] A folder whose name contains `#`, `%`, `&`, or non-ASCII characters.
- [ ] A very deep path (> 260 characters) with long paths enabled.
- [ ] A junction pointing at another folder → opening either path switches to the same tab.
- [ ] Open 15 tabs, then switch to tab 12 with `WinExplorer` (duplicate test) → the right tab
      is selected and Explorer does not crash.
- [ ] Pause, exit WinExplorer, click a folder with the context verb → the app starts and
      opens the folder.
